COVID-19 Vaccination Data Management and Analysis System

Implemented a data management system in Python using SQLite to store and manage COVID-19 vaccination data obtained from a CSV file. The system creates three relational tables with foreign key constraints to store the data in a normalized form. It also includes methods for cleaning and seeding the database and querying specific data. The system allows plotting vaccination trend graphs for specific countries using Matplotlib
